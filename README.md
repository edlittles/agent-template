# üü† Amstelveen Repo for Dungeons and Data Structured
## Getting Started
### Installation
To begin, make sure you have python >= 3.8.x with pip installed on your machine and *GIT*. 

There are 2 installer files that can be used to get your system setup depending on what platform you're working on.
 - If you're operating on a windows machine, use the [am_installer.ps1](blob/main/am_installer.ps1) file.
 - If you're operating on a Mac or Linux machine, use the [am_installer.sh](blob/main/am_installer.sh) file.

### Running the Agent
First, make sure your python environment is activated. You should see `(coderone)` at the start of your terminal prompt if the session is active.  
Then run the following command in your terminal. 
`coderone-dungeon --interactive coderone.dungeon.agent`


### Questions or Issues
If you have any issues or questions getting your system setup, please drop a note in the discord.

# Original Instructions
## üêâ Dungeons and Data Structures - Agent Templates
This Repo contains templates and practise Agents for the AI Sports Challenge 2020 (Dungeons and Data Structures).

Download the Agent file and save this in your working directory for the challenge.

**Agents**:
- `my_agent.py`: a template file to help you get started with your first Agent
- `wanderer.py`: a bot that wanders aimlessly around the map
- `stand_still.py`: a bot that thinks for 1s and does nothing
- `random_agent.py`: a bot that makes random moves
- `flee_bot.py`: a bot that places bombs and runs away

The Agents within the folder **Legacy Agents**, are for an older version of Dungeons and Data Structures, available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M5-V9GR6FDWA8DrtK31HcHlCaPmw8rA6?usp=sharing)
